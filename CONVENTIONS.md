## Conventions

- Preferred upper ontologies: use I-ADOPT and SOSA as the primary alignment targets; avoid introducing additional top-level vocabularies unless necessary.
- Scope: this ontology captures salmon-related terms intended for broad reuse across agencies, organizations, projects, and datasets to maximize interoperability.
- Keep class/property names and alignments consistent with the chosen upper ontologies; document any exceptions inline.
